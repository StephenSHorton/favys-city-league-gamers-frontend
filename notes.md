Client-side calls are blocked because there is no way to make them without exposing your API key to users. You will need to setup a backend server that can make API calls while keeping your API key secure. If you want to quickly setup a proxy server, you can create some functions with AWS Lambda (https://pastebin.com/LYsyfGgD) or use Kernel (https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel).
If your project is only intended for personal usage, you can modify your browser settings to disable CORS (the mechanism which blocks you from making client-side calls). However, you will not be allowed to publish your site if you do this. More info about disabling CORS can be found here: https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/08/bypass-cors-errors-testing-apis-locally/
